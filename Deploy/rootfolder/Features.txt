- Added ToggleSignalButton component for custom messages with two states (ON/OFF)
- Added ModifiableToggleSignalButton component that wraps a SignalButton
- Replaced 3 ModifiableSignalButton with 3 ModifiableToggleSignalButton into the Ardulink Console
- Improved Digispark/PicoDuino support with a recovery connection error routine (still in beta)

Version 0.3.3.20140610

- Added support for chipKIT Uno32

Version 0.3.2.20140517

- BUG FIX
- Added SimpleBinaryProtocol (limited support)
- Added SimpleBinaryProtocol sketches for Digispark/PicoDuino and Arduino UNO boards

- Modified DigisparkConnectionPanel to use SimpleBinaryProtocol insetal of ALProtocol
- tested PicoDuino (that is 100% compatible with Digispark)
- Enhanced message divider mechanism (now just text protocols have to add divider to outgoing messages)
- Added XML to/from JavaBean technology for future use

Version 0.3.1.20140124
