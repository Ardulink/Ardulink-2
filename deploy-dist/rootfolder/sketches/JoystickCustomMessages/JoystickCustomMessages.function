This sketch is an example to understand how Arduino can recognize ALProtocol. 
However, it can easily be reused for their own purposes or as a base for a library. 
Read carefully the comments. When you find "this is general code you can reuse"
then it means that it is generic code that you can use to manage the ALProtocol. 
When you find "this is needed just as example for this sketch" then it means that 
you code useful for a specific purpose. In this case you have to modify it to suit 
your needs.
