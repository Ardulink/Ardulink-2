This sketch is an example to understand how Digispark/PicoDuino can recognize SimpleBynaryProtocol. 
However, it can easily be reused for your own purposes or as a base for a library. 

This sketch is for Digispark/PicoDuino that doesn't support Serial library. Actually it manages
SimpleBynaryProtocol (without responses from Digispark) but just for PIN Power Switch messages.
If you have different needs you have to modify this sketch accordingly.

Remember: Digispark/PicoDuino has just 6.012 bytes memory available for sketches.
