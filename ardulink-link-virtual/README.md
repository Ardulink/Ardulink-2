### ardulink-core-virtual

Contains virtual links mainly designed for testing purposes and showcases. "ardulink://virtual-random" prints out received state changes and provides random values when listening on pins. "ardulink://virtual-console" prints out received state changes and sends commands written to the console back, so virtual-console could be used to link things via stdin/stdout with Ardulink.
