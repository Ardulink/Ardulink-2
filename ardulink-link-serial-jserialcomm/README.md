### ardulink-core-serial-jssc

Contains the link to connect to modules via serial ports using the library [jssc](https://github.com/java-native/jssc) (ardulink://serial-jssc). ardulink-core-base provides an alias for all serial-based ports so you can use "ardulink://serial" as well. Serial ports have the highest priority when using "ardulink://default"
